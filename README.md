#### Installation:
1. Click [here]([https://github.com/pointfeev/CreamInstaller/releases/latest/download/CreamInstaller.zip](https://github.com/ubden/CreamApi/releases)) to download the latest release from [GitHub]([https://github.com/pointfeev/CreamInstaller](https://github.com/ubden/CreamApi/releases)).
2. Extract the executable to anywhere on your computer you want. *It's completely self-contained.*

If the program doesn't seem to launch, try downloading and installing [.NET 7 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-7.0.2-windows-x64-installer).

#### **NOTE:** This program does not automatically download nor install actual DLC files for you. As the title of the program says, it's only a DLC Unlocker installer. Should the game you wish to unlock DLC for not already come with the DLCs installed (very many do not), you have to find, download, and install those yourself. Preferably, you should be referring to the proper cs.rin.ru post for the game(s) you're tinkering with; you'll usually find any answer to your problems there.
